# Discord File Dropper

This Node.js script watches a folder for new files and automatically uploads them to different Discord channels (via webhooks) based on file type.

## How it Works
- Uses chokidar to watch a folder for new files.
- Detects file type using file-type.  
  - Falls back to file extension for plain text formats like .txt, .md, .log, .json, .csv, .html.
- Routes the upload to the correct Discord webhook based on MIME type (image, video, audio, text, application).
- Uploads the file with a short, configuraable message (`File Upload Successful :D`).

## Setup
1. Clone this project with ```git clone https://github.com/ryeleap/LilligantHelper.git``` 
2. Install dependencies with ```npm install```
3. Create a .env file in the project root:
   ```FOLDERPATH=C:/InsertFolderPathHere
   IMAGEWEBHOOKURL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx/yyy
   VIDEOWEBHOOKURL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx/yyy
   AUDIOWEBHOOKURL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx/yyy
   TEXTWEBHOOKURL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx/yyy
   APPWEBHOOKURL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx/yyy
   ```

   - Note: **Make absolute sure that your file path has forward slashes instead of back slashes, will break otherwise**
   - Replace the webhook URLs with ones from your Discord server.

4. Run the script:
   node watcher.js

## Notes
- Upload limits: Discord enforces 8 MB max file size for free servers. Larger files will fail with a 413 Request Entity Too Large error unless your server is boosted or you use Nitro-supported webhooks.  
- Stability settings: Files are only uploaded once theyâ€™ve stopped changing for 2 seconds (stabilityThreshold) to avoid grabbing files mid-write.  
- Supports images, videos, audio, text (hard coded for now), and applications. Unknown file types are skipped.
